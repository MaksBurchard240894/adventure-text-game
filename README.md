# Ord like LLM game
This is a unique text-based adventure inspired by [Ord.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1079000/Ord/) It tells tales 3 words at a time, giving the user an initial situation, 2 options and an outcome. 
But instead of the story being pre-written, it can go anywhere because situations, options, and outcomes are all generated using an LLM with API calls. A Groq API key is required which you can get for free [here](https://console.groq.com/keys]
